# I commit to publicly document which contributions constitute authorship on a scientific paper

This page collects real-world examples of authorship policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective authorship policies!

## Details
The line between "acknowledgement" and "authorship" is not always clear. An authorship statement will never solve this problem, but it should act as a starting point for discussions when lab members are prospectively, or retrospectively, considering their role in a project. It should be publicly documented so that prospective lab members are aware of the authorship policy before applying to join a lab.

## Suggestions
- Acknowledge that authorship can be difficult to define
- State when authorship will be discussed during project development
- Specify how contributions will be acknowledged in publications
- Follow CREDIT taxonomy for defining contributions
- Document the process for determining author order
- Include policy for handling authorship disputes
- Consider contributions that typically constitute authorship vs acknowledgement
