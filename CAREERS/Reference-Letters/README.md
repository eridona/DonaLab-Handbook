# I commit to internally document the procedure for requesting reference letters

This page collects real-world examples of reference letter policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective reference letter policies!

## Details
Career progression, grants, and competitive applications often require reference letters from mentors and supervisors. However, it is not uncommon to reuse the same letter with minimal changes, or even ask lab members to draft their own letters. These practices undermine the purpose of the reference system. SAFE Labs group leaders are required to personally write and sign all recommendation letters they agree to provideâ€”possibly in collaboration with a co-supervisor (but never the subject of the letter).

## Suggestions
- Specify notification period for requests
- Be transparent about reference content
- Include co-supervisors as signatories where appropriate
- Define process for urgent requests
- Document required information from requestor
- Set expectations for letter turnaround time
- Outline preferred submission methods
- Consider policy for post-departure references
