# I commit to publicly document expectations and funding for conference/summer school attendance

This page collects real-world examples of conference and training attendance policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective conference attendance policies!

## Details
Conferences, workshops, and other training opportunities (e.g. summer schools) are valuable resources for dissemination, acquiring new expertise, networking, and career development. Therefore, prospective lab members need to understand the lab policy with respect to attending these opportunities so they can make informed decisions and avoid subsequent expectation mismatch. At a minimum, state the typical lab resources available for attending these opportunities, both with respect to financial support and time, and all lab members in the same role should have equal access to these lab resources.

## Suggestions
- Define limitations on which conferences lab members can attend
- Clarify any restrictions on using personal research funds
- Specify requirements for attendance and financial support
- Outline expectations for different lab roles
- Establish criteria for when projects are ready for presentation
- Keep a transparent record of attendance
- Mark major conferences and related deadlines in the lab calendar
- Discuss opportunities in annual appraisals
