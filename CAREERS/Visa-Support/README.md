# I commit to publicly document the visa application process and associated costs

This page collects real-world examples of visa support policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective visa support policies!

## Details
For international lab members, visa costs and processes can be a significant barrier to joining a lab. Being transparent about these requirements and any available support helps candidates make informed decisions and plan accordingly. Different positions may have different levels of institutional support available for visa processes.

## Suggestions
- Document typical visa costs by country
- Outline application timeline expectations
- Specify which costs are covered by the lab
- Include required language tests and certifications
- List institutional support services available
- Detail healthcare contribution requirements
- Provide guidance for family visa applications
- Include visa renewal procedures
