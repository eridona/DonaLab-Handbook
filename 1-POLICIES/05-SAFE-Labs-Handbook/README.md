# I commit to publicly document my support for, and implementation of, the SAFE Labs Handbook

This page collects real-world examples of SAFE Labs Handbook implementations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective implementation strategies!

## Details
This consists of three required steps:
1. Feature the SAFE Labs logo on your website.
2. Join the SAFE Labs mailing list.
3. Link to the SAFE Labs Handbook for accountability and feedback from lab members.

## Suggestions
- Display the SAFE Labs logo prominently on your lab's website
- Ensure all lab members are aware of the handbook and its contents
- Regularly review and discuss the handbook's implementation in lab meetings
- Create clear documentation of which commitments have been implemented and which are in progress
- Schedule periodic reviews of handbook implementation
- Solicit feedback from lab members on handbook effectiveness
- Share success stories and challenges with the SAFE Labs community

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ The importance of a positive work culture for wellbeing and productivity has become increasingly evident in recent years, but academic science still has a negative reputation in this area. [Here you can find our Lab Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FVUqOQC4R48ENKyJsKzS7PNwspzAZaDL/view?usp=sharing) that contains detailed expectations and commitments by Katja, the PI of the lab. It is the basis for safe, fair, equitable, and informed interactions within the lab. A more detailed version is shared among current lab members.

>This handbook is the result of a dedicated, international workshop called [⁠“SAFE Labs”](https://coen-lab.com/safe-labs/) in 2024, focused on understanding the key barriers to Starting Aware, Fair, and Equitable Labs. The attendees of the first edition of this workshop came up with [guidelines to create Lab Handbooks](https://github.com/SAFE-Labs-Docs/Lab-Handbook). Both the guidelines as well our lab's version of the Handbook will be reviewed and updated.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ The SAFE Labs handbook is a document co-authored by Pip and other group leaders across Europe in 2024 (and is continually updated). You can read more details of the handbook here. Many of the commitments involve publicly documenting important material. Here, I provide links to the location of all that material (if a link is missing, the information has yet to be documented).
