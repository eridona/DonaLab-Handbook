# Shared-Calendar

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Shared-Calendar.

# I commit to establish a shared lab calendar for members to indicate if they are away, at conferences etc.

This page collects real-world examples of shared calendar implementations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective calendar systems!

## Details
This not only makes it clear when regular meetings should be cancelled, or when a lab member should not be expected to respond to emails, but also normalizes the lab policy (whatever that may be) regarding conferences, remote working, vacation etc.

## Suggestions
- Clear instructions for reporting different statuses (e.g. vacation vs conference attendance)
- What specific details should be reported? (e.g. half-day vs full day)  
- Mark major conferences and related deadlines 
- Keep a transparent record of attendance
- Implement a booking system for communal instruments
- Monitor and enforce respectful and fair booking schedules
- Include cultural events and festivities important to lab members
- Set guidelines for advance notice of absences
- Define process for handling scheduling conflicts

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ UCL is Microsoft-based. Unfortunately, we are tied into this system. Therefore, the lab calendar is “outlook” and please only access/change it via outlook. Using Google or other third-party software can cause issues (e.g. you think you edited an event, but you didn’t). The following entries should be included in the lab Calendar: 
>- Attend in Person (AIP) Events: Lab meetings, Journal Clubs etc.
>- For your information (FYI) Events: Talks, deadlines, meetings etc.
>
>Please indicate when you are away from lab according to the following entries...
