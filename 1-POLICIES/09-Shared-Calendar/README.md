# Shared-Calendar

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Shared-Calendar.

# I commit to establish a shared lab calendar for members to indicate if they are away, at conferences etc.

This page collects real-world examples of shared calendar implementations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective calendar systems!

## Details
This not only makes it clear when regular meetings should be cancelled, or when a lab member should not be expected to respond to emails, but also normalizes the lab policy (whatever that may be) regarding conferences, remote working, vacation etc.

## Suggestions
- Clear instructions for reporting different statuses (e.g. vacation vs conference attendance)
- What specific details should be reported? (e.g. half-day vs full day)  
- Mark major conferences and related deadlines 
- Keep a transparent record of attendance
- Implement a booking system for communal instruments
- Monitor and enforce respectful and fair booking schedules
- Include cultural events and festivities important to lab members
- Set guidelines for advance notice of absences
- Define process for handling scheduling conflicts

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Science is collaborative and it’s important to know when people are present. Every lab member is hence requested to add to the Lab Calendar when they’re on vacation or at a conference. Short absences, e.g. to go to the bank, do not need to be communicated unless they happen during scheduled meetings such as the weekly lab meeting. Absences of full days and more need to be added. The main purpose of this is to organize the work with your colleagues and so we don’t panic when we don’t see our colleagues for a few days. The lab calendar also contains information about deadlines for conference applications, lab meetings and institutional seminars. Further calendars to book setups, for lecture schedules and to see when Katja is available are shared in more detail in the lab internal Handbook.

> _[RossiLab 2025](https://rossilab.iit.it/home)_: IIT workflows are based on Microsoft Office 365. Thus, we use the Outlook Calendar to coordinate activities in the lab. To facilitate readability, please be succint when creating new entries. Here are some ground rules on how to use the shared lab calendar:
>
> ABSENCES:Every lab member (PI, post-doc, PhD student, trainee) must write their absences in the lab calendar. There are 4 kinds of absences:
> - XX away (if on holiday)
> - XX on Mars (if on Mars for work)
> - XX remote (if working remotely, we don't need to know where from)
> - XX sick (if on sick leave)
> All of these are for full-day absences. For less than a full day, please don't tell Federico where you are, just go. However, if you are off for a substantial part of the core hours, please send Federico an email – don't worry about clogging his inbox. If you have suggestions on how to improve these rules, let me know and I would be happy to discuss.
>
> MEETINGS: The following entries should be included in the lab Calendar: 
>- Attend in Person (AIP) Events: Lab meetings, Journal Clubs etc.
>- For your information (FYI) Events: Talks, deadlines, meetings etc.
>  
> SHARED FACILITIES/RIGS: We manage usage/booking of lab rigs and facility by maintaining dedicated calendars. As the lab grows, to facilitate experiment planning across users, please plan your experiments and book them in advance.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ UCL is Microsoft-based. Unfortunately, we are tied into this system. Therefore, the lab calendar is “outlook” and please only access/change it via outlook. Using Google or other third-party software can cause issues (e.g. you think you edited an event, but you didn’t). The following entries should be included in the lab Calendar: 
>- Attend in Person (AIP) Events: Lab meetings, Journal Clubs etc.
>- For your information (FYI) Events: Talks, deadlines, meetings etc.
>
>Please indicate when you are away from lab according to the following entries...
