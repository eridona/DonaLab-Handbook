# I commit to publicly document the common lab language and any institutional language requirements

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
English is the international language of science in the 21st century: proficiency in English is a crucial skill to nurture for every scientist. However, lab members are often not native English speakers, and in some cases the Institutional language may not be English. It is therefore important to document the lab and institutional language policy (even in "obvious" cases). To help non-native English speakers—or non-native speakers of the local language—it is also valuable to highlight any institutional support for language acquisition.

## Suggestions
- Identify English as the lab language, and document language code of conduct
- Lead by example and adopt the most inclusive communication format
- Clearly indicate language requirements in job posts
- Document available training in English, particularly scientific writing and presentation
- Document available training in the Institutional and/or local language
- Document lab policy about using LLMs (i.e. ChatGPT) to improve written output
- Address language barriers in meetings, adopting formats of Q/A that facilitate feedback

### France
>_[BugeonLab_2025](https://www.inmed.fr/en/circuits-neuronaux-et-codage-sensoriel):_ English is the official language of the lab. All scientific activities, including meetings, presentations, and written communication, are to be conducted in English. This policy is upheld to ensure an inclusive environment for all members, regardless of their native language. An exception is made for undergraduate students, who may present their work in French in accordance with the university's primary language of instruction. Furthermore, while the lab operates in English, daily interactions within the broader institute often occur in French. We encourage non-French speaking members to learn French to aid in their integration. Aix-Marseille Université offers language courses to support this.

### Germany
The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English. Nonthless, some administrative exchanges are in German and the institute offers assistance in learning the German language.

### Italy
>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ The official language of the institute and the lab is English. Speaking a commonly used language is a sign of inclusivity but is also a crucial skill for science communication. By speaking Italian or other languages that are not English with other people present or entering the room, you are actively excluding your colleagues from the conversation. This is not acceptable at the workplace. For example, if you meet with someone in the cafeteria for a private conversation it’s ok to speak e.g. Italian. But if go for lunch with other Italian lab members and speak Italian, then a non-Italian member joins the table, it is NOT ok to continue in Italian.

> _[RossiLab 2025](https://rossilab.iit.it)_: The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges.  Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal exchanges should adopt the common language that allow everyone to participate.

> The institutional language at the Italian Institute of Technology is English; nonetheless, many administrative exchanges and, alas, some forms, of Italian bureaucracy are still in Italian. Proficiency in Italian is therefore useful within the institute, as well as when traveling throughout the country.
> 
> For our scientific production, I encourage the use LLMs to proofread and refine original written material; however, I won't accept fully AI generated material. Instead, I incentivise the use of LLMs and other AI tools to streamline and automate bureaucracy, coding and other procedures by providing paid access to the most modern tools (e.g. currently, chatGPT).

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable.
