# I commit to publicly document the common lab language and any institutional language requirements

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
English is the international language of science in the 21st century: proficiency in English is a crucial skill to nurture for every scientist. However, lab members are often not native English speakers, and in some cases the Institutional language may not be English. It is therefore important to document the lab and institutional language policy (even in "obvious" cases). To help non-native English speakers—or non-native speakers of the local language—it is also valuable to highlight any institutional support for language acquisition.

## Suggestions
- Identify English as the lab language, and document language code of conduct
- Lead by example and adopt the most inclusive communication format
- Clearly indicate language requirements in job posts
- Document available training in English, particularly scientific writing and presentation
- Document available training in the Institutional and/or local language
- Document lab policy about using LLMs (i.e. ChatGPT) to improve written output
- Address language barriers in meetings, adopting formats of Q/A that facilitate feedback

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ The lab language is English. Any professional conversation, oral and written, during work activities must be in English: these include presentations and discussion at lab meetings, scientific output, and email exchanges. Feel free to use LLMs to proofread and refine written text. However, fully AI generated text is not acceptable. Outside of professional meetings, the lab strives for inclusive communication: verbal exchanges should adopt the common language that allows everyone present to participate.
