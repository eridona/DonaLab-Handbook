# Incident-Reporting

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Incident-Reporting.

# I commit to internally document the procedure for reporting bullying and/or harassment

This page collects real-world examples of incident reporting procedures from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective incident reporting procedures!

## Details
Bullying and harassment are serious allegations and entirely unacceptable in any work environment. By explicitly highlighting the procedure for reporting these issues, group leaders not only demonstrate their commitment to eradicating these behaviors, but also increase the chance that violations witnessed by lab members will be reported.

## Suggestions
- Specify how bullying and harassment is defined by the institution
- Document institutional procedures for reporting and any supporting body/resources available
- Disseminate and value training events offered by the institution
- Include multiple reporting channels
- Outline protection against retaliation
- Detail confidentiality policies
- Specify timeline expectations for investigations
- Include resources for victim support
- Document follow-up procedures

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Under no circumstances do we support any form of bullying or harassment, whether verbal or physical. SISSA has multiple measures in place to report bullying and harassment, and to receive psychological support as well as help with possible actions and consequences. The following four routes can be taken if someone experiences bullying and harassment:
>- Talk to the PI and/or the PhD coordinator: For less severe cases or if one wants to first have an informal chat about incidences, the PI as well as the PhD coordinator can be contacted. 
>- The CUG representative: The CUG (Comitato Unico di Garanzia â€“ Committee for equal opportunities) representative is the official contact person to report bullying and harassment.  
>- Talk to the ombuds person: The ombuds person, like the PI, do not have legal knowledge and are not entitled to take any actions, but they are an independent and confidential resource with more extensive knowledge of possible actions and consequences.
>- School psychologist: The services of the school psychologist can be used free of charge. Beyond a psychological degree, they also have legal knowledge and can help you decide on the next steps.

Contact details can be found in our extended version of the Lab Handbook.
