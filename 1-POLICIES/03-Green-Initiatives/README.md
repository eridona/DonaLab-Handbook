# We only have one planet: respect it!

Research inevitably consumes energy and generates waste, but we can—and should—strive to minimize our environmental footprint. All lab members are expected to act responsibly and adopt sustainable practices whenever possible.
- **Waste Management**: Ensure proper disposal of hazardous materials. If you’re unsure about how to discard a substance, consult safety data sheets or ask for guidance. Always recycle when appropriate.
- **Energy Use**: Be mindful of electricity consumption. Turn off lights, equipment, and appliances when they are not in use.
- **Sustainable Purchasing**: Whenever feasible, choose products from companies that offer environmentally friendly options or use minimal packaging. Share surplus consumables with others to avoid unnecessary waste.
