# I commit to publicly document green initiatives in the lab and any explicit rules related to sustainability

This page collects real-world examples of lab sustainability initiatives from around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own green initiatives here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective sustainability policies!

## Details
Laboratories consume a lot of energy and produce a lot of waste. Group leaders are able to promote measures that reduce the environmental impact of scientific research, and prospective lab members may use environmental awareness as a factor when choosing labs.

## Suggestions
- Require sustainable transport options when travel time is less than 8 hours
- Recycle non-hazardous waste
- Place orders in bulk to reduce shipments
- Have a list of instruments you are happy to share with your internal collaborators
- Donate unused equipment within/outside the institutions
- Highlight schemes that incentivise sustainable commuting (e.g. cycle schemes)

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Research consumes a lot of energy and produces a lot of waste. While this cannot always be avoided
for experimental or safety reasons, we have rules in place to minimize our footprint as much as possible:
>
>Travels: Team members are required to travel by train or similar public transport means for trips <8h. Exceptions need to be discussed with the PI. SISSA employees can get a 10%discount on all Freccia travels, including private ones.
>
>Correct waste management: Team members get instructed on correct disposal of hazardous waste and are requested to check safety information before discarding products they are not familiar with. Both in and outside the labs we have recycling bins for paper and plastic, and everyone is encouraged to use these for non-hazardous waste.
>
>Bulk orders: Italian law requires public entities to use economical solutions, which includes combining orders to the same company from various labs. Furthermore, SISSA has the “Neurostore” which provides labs with many of the daily used consumables which hence can be ordered in large quantities to reduce shipping.
>
>Shared facilities: We have quite a large number of shared facilities and equipment. These are managed by the technical staff and can be used by all SISSA labs.
>
>
>_[RossiLab](https://rossilab.iit.it/home)_: The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment.
>
>Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and for daily commute. For long-hauls trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most sustainable travel option (up to 150% the price of the cheapest alternative). IIT policies also encourages the use of public transport over private cars and taxis. Lab members are encouraged to combine their work trips with other activities to reduce future emissions, like visiting related labs or institutes in the local area, or simply taking a holiday: in compliance with IIT policies, onwards or returning travel on away days will be covered if similar or less expensive. I incentivize sustainable options for daily commute: undergrad, master and PhD students enrolled at University of Trento benefit from [discounted public transportation across the Trentino region](https://www.provincia.tn.it/Servizi/Abbonamenti-trasporto-studenti-universitari). 
>
>Recycling: We recycle waste whenever possible. In the office space, segregated recylcing bins are provided and disposed of by cleaners; in the labs, we actively arrange our own recycling bins, and empty them when full. To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. Finally, we order equipment from local companies when the difference in cost is minimal.
>
>Economical use of equipment: when possible and not detrimental our instruments, we turn off unused equipment when prolonged downtime is forecasted.

### United Kingdom
>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ The lab strives to minimise energy consumption and waste production. We identified three main areas of impact: travel, recycling and economical use of equipment.
>
>Travel: I encourage sustainable transport options both for long-haul travel and for daily commute. For long-haul trips, when funding allows, I will cover the most sustainable travel option. I also recognise remote-working hours spent productively on sustainable means of transport during private (non-work-related) trips. Lab members are also encouraged to combine their work trips with other activities to reduce future emissions, like visiting related labs or institutes in the local area, or simply taking a holiday. I incentivize sustainable options for daily commute: PhD students benefit from reduced costs on public transportation across, and all staff can participate in UCL’s cycle scheme to purchase a bike through salary sacrifice (meaning that the effective cost is reduced and spread over time).
>
>Recycling: To minimize the environmental impact of lab waste, we avoid mixing truly contaminated materials (which is expensive and environmentally harmful to safely dispose of) with clean recyclable waste. We recycle waste whenever possible, and order equipment from local companies when the difference in cost is minimal.
>
>Economical use of equipment: when possible and not detrimental our instruments, we turn off unused equipment when prolonged downtime is forecasted.
