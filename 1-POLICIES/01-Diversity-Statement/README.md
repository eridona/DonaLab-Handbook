# I commit to publicly document a diversity statement

This page collects real-world examples of diversity statements from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own diversity statements here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective diversity statements!

## Details
Science is an international endeavour, which brings together people from many cultures. This statement is an opportunity to specify the steps you, and your institution, have taken to support a diversity of researchers with differing needs and backgrounds.

## Suggestions
- Make clear what are the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave
- Normalize specifying pronouns in email signatures and profiles (e.g. slack)
- Encourage people to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events/festivities
- Encourage attendance of EDI training
- Discuss steps taken to facilitate diversity in applicants
- During onboarding, discuss cultural needs (e.g. religious holidays, prayer facilities)
- Dedicate some meetings (e.g. journal club) to papers addressing diversity in science
- Consider diversity of voices when selecting papers in journal clubs

>_[BugeonLab_2025](https://www.inmed.fr/en/circuits-neuronaux-et-codage-sensoriel):_ Our lab is committed to building a diverse and inclusive scientific community. We believe that groundbreaking science is driven by the creative energy that emerges from a mix of perspectives, backgrounds, and life experiences. To that end, I actively welcome and mentor researchers from all cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds. My goal is to foster a supportive and collaborative environment where every member feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique insights. 

### Germany
We believe that diversity is a resource to harness, and we strive to create a psychologically safe environment where disruptive points of view are valued. Thus, to foster a diverse and inclusive environment, we hire according to institutional affirmative action policies; we review the institutional rules for maternity and paternity leave when negotiating a contract; we discuss any cultural needs at onboarding, and we encourage lab members to share and mark on the lab calendar crucial cultural events and festivities; finally, we promote diversity in science by selecting journal club papers from a diversity of voices. We hope that these policies will encourage individuals from different cultural, socioeconomic, gender, and geographical backgrounds to join. Women and members of a minority group can contact Humboldt University’s women’s adviser for guidance and financial support regarding specific challenges in their careers.
