# Diversity drives discovery

I believe that diversity in science fosters creativity by enabling the exchange of ideas shaped by different cultural backgrounds, life experiences, and perspectives across gender, socioeconomic status, and more. With the aim of creating a welcoming space for everyone, we take practical steps to support inclusion and well-being. These include discussing equity, inclusion, and any cultural needs during onboarding; encouraging lab members to share important cultural events and festivities; and providing flexibility around work hours, parental leave, and financial or cultural considerations. Since many institutional documents are in Italian, particular attention is given to ensuring that all essential information is translated into English, which is maintained as the official language of the lab.
