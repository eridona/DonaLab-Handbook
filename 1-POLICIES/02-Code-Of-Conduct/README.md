# Lab code of conduct

## ðŸ§­ Core Principles

All lab members are expected to uphold the following core principles:

- **Honesty**: Scientific integrity is non-negotiable. Be transparent in your work and never compromise on ethical standards. Seek help when neededâ€”asking questions or admitting uncertainty is a strength, not a weakness.  
  Lab members can refer to the [CNR institutional page on research integrity](https://www.cnr.it/it/ethics) for official policies and guidance.
- **Respect**: Every lab memberâ€™s opinion matters. While critical thinking is encouraged, feedback should always be constructive and aimed at fostering meaningful dialogue and personal development. Disagreement is welcome, as long as itâ€™s expressed respectfully.
- **Engagement**: Curiosity, initiative, and commitment are essential. Strive for excellence in your research, and take an active role in lab activitiesâ€”this includes lab meetings, seminars, and collaborative discussions. The success of the lab depends on the enthusiasm and contributions of its members.
