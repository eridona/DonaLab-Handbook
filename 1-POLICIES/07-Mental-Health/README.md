# I commit to internally document available resources to support mental health

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Thankfully, awareness and support for mental health issues within work environments is at an all-time high. It is likely that these issues will arise within any research group at some time, and it is equally likely that the group leader is not qualified to offer advice or guidance—particularly given the potential for a conflict-of-interest. It is therefore critical that lab members are made aware of the resources available to them at both an institutional and national level.

## Suggestions
- Should lab members approach you with work-related and/or non-work-related issues?
- Educate lab members on mental health, and how to prevent and recognise arising issues
- Document institutional resources for psychological support
- Highlight the institutional policy on mental health and sick leave
- Promote good practices to safe-guard mental health (e.g. work-life balance)

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Mental health is an important topic – we want our colleagues to be happy and healthy. Making use of mental health infrastructure is strongly encouraged and the PI is always open to discussing necessary adjustments or breaks to improve the well-being of the team members and to ensure that they can successfully and healthily complete their PhD or projects. Lab members are encouraged to bring up any possible issues that are related to the work environment (hours, relationships with colleagues, uncertainty about professional future etc.) with the PI as early as possible. For personal issues that are not related to your work, the PI will usually not be the best person to contact as they are likely not qualified or might have conflicts of interest; for these cases, lab members should get in touch with the school psychologist.
