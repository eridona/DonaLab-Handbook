# I commit to internally document available resources to support mental health

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Thankfully, awareness and support for mental health issues within work environments is at an all-time high. It is likely that these issues will arise within any research group at some time, and it is equally likely that the group leader is not qualified to offer advice or guidanceâ€”particularly given the potential for a conflict-of-interest. It is therefore critical that lab members are made aware of the resources available to them at both an institutional and national level.

## Suggestions
- Should lab members approach you with work-related and/or non-work-related issues?
- Educate lab members on mental health, and how to prevent and recognise arising issues
- Document institutional resources for psychological support
- Highlight the institutional policy on mental health and sick leave
- Promote good practices to safe-guard mental health (e.g. work-life balance)
