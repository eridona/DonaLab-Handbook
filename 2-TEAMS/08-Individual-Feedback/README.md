# I commit to establish annual bilateral feedback and appraisal sessions for each lab member

This page collects real-world examples of individual feedback approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Having (at least) an annual 1-on-1 meeting with each lab member dedicated to exchanging bilateral feedback and giving advice on career development. This is required by some, but not all, institutions. These sessions provide structured opportunities for in-depth discussions about progress, goals, and mutual expectations.

## Suggestions
- Discuss career development and courses for both scientific and non-scientific skills
- Review the frequency of 1-on-1 meetings for the upcoming year
- Discuss grant-writing opportunities and plan application strategy
- Consider quarterly meetings to discuss career goals
- Solicit feedback on improving your mentorship and the lab support
- Evaluate project progression based on milestones, rather than just specific results
- Celebrate all publications equally regardless of journal

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ All lab members have 1o1 meetings with the PI as illustrated in the section "Regular meetings". In addition, at the end of each year, the PI meets with every lab member separately to provide mutual feedback and discuss future plans. These meetings follow a structured outline, require preparation on both the PI and team member side, and ensure that feedback is constructive and bidirectional.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ All lab members have 1-on-1 meetings with Pip every week. In **January**, one of these meetings will be dedicated to bilateral feedback. A form will be provided, with sections to be completed before, during, and after, the meeting.

>The goal of these sessions is to provide a dedicated meeting for reflection and mutual growth. It *does not* mean you should refrain from providing feedback at other times of the year (if you feel uncomfortable doing this directly, there is an *anonymous feedback form* available.
>
>Before these sessions, it is most helpful you not only think about areas for potential improvement, but also *how* you would like those improvements to be achieved.
>
>Pip will not necessarily be able, or willing, to implement all suggested changes. However, when something will not be implemented—or partially so—he will discuss the reasoning behind these decisions with you. If he fails to do this, please tell him and assume incompetence rather than malice!
