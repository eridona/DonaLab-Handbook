# I commit to establish annual bilateral feedback and appraisal sessions for each lab member

This page collects real-world examples of individual feedback approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Having (at least) an annual 1-on-1 meeting with each lab member dedicated to exchanging bilateral feedback and giving advice on career development. This is required by some, but not all, institutions. These sessions provide structured opportunities for in-depth discussions about progress, goals, and mutual expectations.

## Suggestions
- Discuss career development and courses for both scientific and non-scientific skills
- Review the frequency of 1-on-1 meetings for the upcoming year
- Discuss grant-writing opportunities and plan application strategy
- Consider quarterly meetings to discuss career goals
- Solicit feedback on improving your mentorship and the lab support
- Evaluate project progression based on milestones, rather than just specific results
- Celebrate all publications equally regardless of journal
