# I commit to establish a mechanism to record key outcomes from each 1-on-1 meeting

This page collects real-world examples of meeting record-keeping approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Commonly reported frustrations of the 1-on-1 meeting process in labs are:
1. Lab members feel that their group leader forgets the content of their previous meeting and so appears disengaged, or time is wasted rehashing the previous meeting.
2. Group leaders feel that a previously agreed course of action has not been followed (or even attempted) and the lab member has instead pursued an unrelated tangent.

Recording the key outcomes of each 1-on-1 meeting immediately after it takes place has been reported to robustly improve these issues. It allows any miscommunication to be readily identified, and provides a way for all participants to refresh their memory before the next meeting—saving time and confusion.

## Suggestions
- Require lab members to summarize each meeting in a shared document
- Include agreed-upon action points to prioritize before the next meeting
- Lab members should take notes during the meeting
- Group leader should read the document after/before meetings (to catch misunderstandings)
- Other solutions include allowing the lab member to record meetings (e.g. via zoom)

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ All lab members are requested to send a short summary email to the PI after each 1o1 meeting. These can be bullet-point style but should contain concrete plans/agreements/outcomes. This format ensures that there’s a paper trail of what has been discussed and agreed on, but also that the PI and the lab member have the same understanding of the discussed matter.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Every lab member has a 1-on-1 meeting with their supervisor once per week. For post docs and PhD students, this will be Pip, but for Masters students and undergraduates, this may be another lab member. There is a dedicted (private) page for each lab member's 1-on-1 meeting.
>
>The supervisor, and lab member, both have responsibilities during this meeting. In brief: both parties should add discussion points to the meeting page throughout the week, and then during the meeting, they should go over these discussion points and update the to-do list. After the meeting, the lab member should write a summary of the meeting (100-200 words).
