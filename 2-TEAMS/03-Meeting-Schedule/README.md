# I commit to publicly document an overview of the regular meetings in the lab, and my expectations for participation

This page collects real-world examples of lab meeting schedules from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Labs often have a variety of regular meetings, including 1-on-1 meetings, lab meetings and journal clubs. However, the expectations for the contents of these meetings are rarely documented, leading to misunderstandings and uncertainty. Clear documentation not only reveals useful information about lab life, but also ensures that meetings are more effective and fruitful. As a minimum, this should include the frequency, duration, and the agenda for each type of meeting.

## Suggestions
- Discuss 1-on-1 meeting frequency at onboarding, and review in annual appraisals
- Create a shared space where past presentations can be accessed
- Encourage participation and involvement from all lab members, for example:
  1. Round table feedback
  2. Lab members write down their thoughts, then all of them are read
  3. Allocate time in meetings for problem solving and a brainstorming session
  4. Have a meeting facilitator and/or note taker; rotate among lab members
- Conduct regular team-building activities (e.g. lab retreat, dinners, celebrations)

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ At the time of writing, the lab meets as a group twice per week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10am–pastries are provided! These are typically Journal Clubs (presentation of a paper) on Tuesdays and Data Clubs (update on a project) on Thursdays. However, meetings are sometimes focused on other lab business, including training, external speakers, feedback sessions, or mini-hackathons.

>The expectations for regular meetings are laid out in detail on our lab wiki, but most meetings have a presenter, responsible for leading the meeting, and someone taking notes on the content. All group meetings are in-person events, although we record meetings online for posterity, and to allow participation from those who can’t attend in person.
>
>Individually, I meet with every lab member at least once per week, unless one of us is out of town, to discuss their project and any other issues. After each meeting, lab members write a brief summary of the meeting to ensure that the discussion is recorded, and to serve as a starting point for the next meeting.
