# I commit to publicly document an overview of the regular meetings in the lab, and my expectations for participation

This page collects real-world examples of lab meeting schedules from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Labs often have a variety of regular meetings, including 1-on-1 meetings, lab meetings and journal clubs. However, the expectations for the contents of these meetings are rarely documented, leading to misunderstandings and uncertainty. Clear documentation not only reveals useful information about lab life, but also ensures that meetings are more effective and fruitful. As a minimum, this should include the frequency, duration, and the agenda for each type of meeting.

## Suggestions
- Discuss 1-on-1 meeting frequency at onboarding, and review in annual appraisals
- Create a shared space where past presentations can be accessed
- Encourage participation and involvement from all lab members, for example:
  1. Round table feedback
  2. Lab members write down their thoughts, then all of them are read
  3. Allocate time in meetings for problem solving and a brainstorming session
  4. Have a meeting facilitator and/or note taker; rotate among lab members
- Conduct regular team-building activities (e.g. lab retreat, dinners, celebrations)

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ We have three types of regular meetings:
>- Lab Meetings: Tuesdays 13:30 – 15:30. These meetings are mandatory and to be attended in-person unless otherwise agreed on with the PI. Meetings may last less than 2h. Lab meetings have the following format: Every 2 weeks data/journal club with a main presenter, and every other 2 weeks general lab meetings. In the "general lab meetings" everyone, including the PI, presents for max. 10-15min. Everyone should focus on 1-2 things they achieved in the past 2 weeks (important: an achievement can be a first pilot experiment, having fixed an issue with a setup, having identified an issue, having written 1 paragraph…) and 1-2 things they plan to do in the next two weeks. These presentations should have a very short introduction (max. 1 slide, a few sentences) to the project or technique and the description of the achievements; future plans should be short and concise so that there’s time within 10-15min for feedback/help/ideas. The purpose of these meetings is NOT to compare productivity or judge each other, but to keep everyone updated on what’s going on in the lab and to provide space to discuss “minor” achievements or issues without having to wait weeks for the next data club. 
>- 1o1 meetings: The PI meets regularly 1o1 with every lab member. PhD candidates can choose between a weekly or biweekly format; postdocs and technicians agree with the PI on a format that works best (regular, when necessary depending on the project status). Master students and interns may have biweekly or monthly meetings with the PI, depending on the degree of supervision by the PhDs/postdocs in the lab. All lab members are requested to send a short summary email to the PI after each 1o1 meeting. These can be bullet-point style but should contain concrete plans/agreements/outcomes. This format ensures that there’s a paper trail of what has been discussed and agreed on, but also that the PI and the lab member have the same understanding of the discussed matter.
>- Yearly feedback meetings: At the end of each year, the PI meets with every lab member separately to provide mutual feedback and discuss future plans. These meetings follow a structured outline, require preparation on both the PI and team member side, and ensure that feedback is constructive and bidirectional.

### United Kingdom
>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ At the time of writing, the lab meets as a group twice per week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10am–pastries are provided! These are typically Journal Clubs (presentation of a paper) on Tuesdays and Data Clubs (update on a project) on Thursdays. However, meetings are sometimes focused on other lab business, including training, external speakers, feedback sessions, or mini-hackathons.
>
>The expectations for regular meetings are laid out in detail on our lab wiki, but most meetings have a presenter, responsible for leading the meeting, and someone taking notes on the content. All group meetings are in-person events, although we record meetings online for posterity, and to allow participation from those who can’t attend in person.
>
>Individually, I meet with every lab member at least once per week, unless one of us is out of town, to discuss their project and any other issues. After each meeting, lab members write a brief summary of the meeting to ensure that the discussion is recorded, and to serve as a starting point for the next meeting.
