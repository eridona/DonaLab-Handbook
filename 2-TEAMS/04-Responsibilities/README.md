# I commit to publicly document the responsibilities of each lab role and the training provided

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Each group leader has their own expectations for lab roles (PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, lab technicians etc.). By explicitly stating the responsibilities associated to different positions, group leaders can pre-empt expectation mismatch for prospective lab members before and after they join the lab.

## Suggestions
- What is the training/experience/independence expected for each role?
- Does the role involve a research project?
- Does the role involve applying for funding?
- Does the role involve supervising other lab members?
- Will the role be supervised by another lab member?
- Does the role involve house-keeping tasks?
- What level of supervision/training will be offered?

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Our team is composed of postdocs, PhD candidates, undergraduates and technicians. Each role comes with different responsibilities and training opportunities. These are outlined in a table accessible both in the public and internal [Lab Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FVUqOQC4R48ENKyJsKzS7PNwspzAZaDL/view).

_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Our team is composed by researchers with different roles. Expectations for each role, and what they can expect from other lab members, is detailed in the table below. Please contact Pip if you have any questions or concerns about this table. This is a guide and not a limitation. Exceptions will happen (e.g. sometimes a principle project can be collaborative, rather than independent, or an undergrad may contribute to a paper), but this guide is accurate for most cases. The corresponding table of responsibilites can be found _[here](https://coen-lab.com/lab-life/#Role-Expectations)._
