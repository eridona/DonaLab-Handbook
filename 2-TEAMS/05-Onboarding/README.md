# I commit to publicly document the onboarding procedure for new lab members

This page collects real-world examples of onboarding procedures from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
A clear onboarding process should not only ensure that lab members complete essential administrative processes, but also that each lab member starts with the same level of pastoral support and lab-integration. This process must include the sharing and discussion of this SAFE Labs Handbook.

## Suggestions
- Send general email to introduce new lab members
- Signing a contract/being added to payroll
- Getting an ID & institutional email address
- Fire/safety inductions
- Lab access
- Joining lab calendar/wiki/slack etc.
- Assigning a workstation
- Schedule 1-on-1 meetings with the group leader, and discuss their frequency
- Mandatory institutional courses
- Pairing with a "lab buddy" to act as a point of contact etc.
