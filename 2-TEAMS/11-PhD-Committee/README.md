# I commit to establish a "PhD steering committee" to annually monitor progress and mediate feedback

This page collects real-world examples of PhD steering committee approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
A PhD steering committee provides independent oversight of PhD student progress and can mediate any feedback between student and supervisor. This reduces the power imbalance in the student-supervisor relationship and provides additional mentorship opportunities. The committee should meet at least annually to review progress and provide career guidance.

## Suggestions
- Select committee members with complementary expertise
- Include at least one member external to the department
- Document meeting outcomes and next steps
- Set clear milestones and timelines
- Provide guidance on thesis structure and content
- Discuss career development and opportunities
- Review publication progress and plans

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Two types of feedback and steering measures are in place:
>- Annual progress reports: Every PhD student presents their research and answers questions during a public presentation that includes at least all Neurobiology faculty. These progress report meetings are annual at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year. They are followed by a discussion among the faculty (without the student) and by an official written report that will be shared with the student. A discussion between the student and the committee, but without the supervisor, is not part of this format. However, PhD students have yearly meetings with the PhD coordinator to raise general issues and can request a meeting with the coordinator at any point during their PhD to discuss issues with their supervisor.
>- External mentorship program: In addition to the school-intern reports, our lab has established an external mentorship program. For every student, we identify an external scientist who meets with the student at least twice a year for 2h (online), starting at the end of their first year. These meetings exclude the supervisor and can be used by the student as they wish, to discuss data, methods, career etc.
