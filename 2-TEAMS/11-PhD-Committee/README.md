# I commit to establish a "PhD steering committee" to annually monitor progress and mediate feedback

This page collects real-world examples of PhD steering committee approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
A PhD steering committee provides independent oversight of PhD student progress and can mediate any feedback between student and supervisor. This reduces the power imbalance in the student-supervisor relationship and provides additional mentorship opportunities. The committee should meet at least annually to review progress and provide career guidance.

## Suggestions
- Select committee members with complementary expertise
- Include at least one member external to the department
- Document meeting outcomes and next steps
- Set clear milestones and timelines
- Provide guidance on thesis structure and content
- Discuss career development and opportunities
- Review publication progress and plans
