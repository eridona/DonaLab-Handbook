# I commit to establish annual lab-wide meetings to normalise failures

This page collects real-world examples of approaches to normalizing failures from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Research can be frustrating, with failures and falsified hypotheses outnumbering successes. Most failures are "good" failures: those where you discover something about the system you are working on, and improve future work through the experience. These failures are the stepping stones to discovery, and should be celebrated. Implementing an annual meeting where all lab members, including the group leader, recount their most successful failure will help normalise these events as learning and growth opportunities.

## Suggestions
- Each lab member could discuss a failed experiment, application, or endeavour
- Institute a prize for best failure, elected by general vote
- Discuss what was learned from each failure
- Share strategies for overcoming setbacks
- Document lessons learned for future reference
- Celebrate the learning opportunities failures present
- Create a supportive environment for discussing challenges

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ We currently do not hold annual lab-wide meetings targeted at normalizing failures. If this format is deemed useful by the lab members, it’ll be implemented in the future. Normalizing failures is part of daily interactions and during the weekly lab meetings, including reports of past/present failures of the PI.

Many failures are "good" failures: those where you discover something about the system you are working on, and improve future work through the experience.

>**Some failure just suck**—and the only “lesson” is that academia (and life) sucks sometimes.

>Each year (in January) we will dedicate one meeting to this topic: everyone will talk about (at least) one professional failure from the past year—it could be anything from an experimental issue to a rejected application. The exact format will evolve with time, so for more specifics of the agenda and process, please look at the corresponding entry in the Lab Meetings database.
