# ⚖️ Work-Life-Balance

Maintaining a healthy work–life balance is essential for long-term well-being, productivity, and creativity. The lab aims to foster a flexible and respectful environment that supports both professional growth and personal needs.

### 🕒 Working Hours

Working hours follow institutional policy and are generally flexible. However, lab members are expected to be present during **core hours**:
- **10:00–12:00** and **14:00–17:00**

These hours ensure overlap for collaboration, meetings, and shared activities.  
We recognize that parental responsibilities and other personal needs may require additional flexibility. Exceptions and adjustments to working hours should be discussed in advance with the **PI** to accommodate these circumstances.

### 💻 Remote Work

Lab members are generally expected to be physically present in the lab **at least 4 days per week** to maintain an active, interactive research environment.  
Remote work may be permitted under specific circumstances (e.g., thesis writing, short-term personal needs) and should be agreed upon with the PI.

### 🌴 Vacation and Time Off

All lab members are **encouraged to take their full annual leave**, as defined by their employment contract. Taking regular breaks is vital for maintaining mental and physical health.

Vacation plans should be communicated in advance to avoid disruptions to ongoing lab activities.

### 🕌 Cultural and Religious Observances

While the lab follows the **national holiday calendar**, members are welcome to adapt their time off to accommodate **cultural or religious festivities** specific to their background.  
Such flexibility should be managed in coordination with the PI to ensure proper planning and fairness across the team.
