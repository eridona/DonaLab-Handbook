# Work-Life-Balance

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Work-Life-Balance.

# I commit to publicly document my expectations for working hours, remote working, and vacation

This page collects real-world examples of work-life balance policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Lab rules for working hours should be clear to avoid any conflict or misunderstanding inside the lab. Having clear expectations for working hours can also increase equity between lab members. Moreover, group leaders need to ensure that lab members feel safe to correctly balance their work in the lab with their life. The lab policy regarding work hours, remote working, and vacation should be explicitly included.

## Suggestions
- Should notice of holidays be given and how?
- Are there core-working hours (typically less than the full working hours)?
- Should lab members schedule messages if sent outside of working hours?
- What times are appropriate times for scheduling meetings?
- Establish clear policies for vacation requests and approval
- Define expectations for remote work arrangements
- Specify communication protocols outside working hours
- Document policies for flexible working arrangements

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Experimental science rarely fits into a 9-5 schedule. Experiments might take longer, trouble shooting may cause delays, or urgent deadlines require longer working hours. 
>- Work hours: While individual working days may not follow a standard schedule, the average work week should be 40h and everyone is entitled to 20 days of vacation (if on a fellowship) or to the time and days detailed in their contract (if on a work contract). In practice, this means that there might be days or even weeks where lab members work more than 8h/day or 40h/week, but this should be compensated by lighter schedules in subsequent weeks, days off or longer vacations to ensure well-being. Conference attendance etc. counts as working hours!
>- Core work hours: To enable flexibility, we have short core work hours. Team members are expected to be present or available online from 11am to 3pm every workday as well as during scheduled meetings such as lab meetings. This ensures at least a minimal possibility for interactions between lab members. You can expect that, with as few exceptions as possible, seminars and mandatory meetings will be scheduled between 9am and 4pm. 
>- Working from home: During experimental phases, team members are expected to be at the institute 4 days per week. Changes to this, e.g. during data analysis and writing times, are possible but should be discussed with the PI. Lab meetings are to be attended in person. Exceptions will be granted only for specific situations.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ I am committed to creating a healthy work environment for all lab members that prioritises mental health and wellbeing. Academic research should be an exciting, rewarding, and engaging job. Certainly, it can be challenging, and stressful at times, but it should not be depressing, or life-consuming. I anticipate all lab members taking a minimum of XXX's prescribed 41 days of annual leave. "Minimum" because if experiments necessitate working on a weekend, or you attend a conference that's scheduled on a weekend, I support lab members taking time off to compensate for this. I hope to schedule all meetings within UCL's "core" work hours of 10am to 4pm. And I will refrain from sending, or answering, non-urgent emails/messages outside of work hours.
>
>All full-time lab members should aim to work onsite at least four days a week. I expect this number to reduce (probably to "three") once the lab is operational and more time is being spent analysing data rather than building rigs/training mice. In general, I believe that some regular onsite presence is important to maintain the lab community. However, I am happy to support intermittent periods of fully-remote working when, for example, traveling/visiting family abroad or writing up a thesis/grant.
