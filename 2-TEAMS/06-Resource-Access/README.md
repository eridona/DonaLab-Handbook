# Resource-Access

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Resource-Access.

# I commit to publicly document how equal access to lab resources across lab members is maintained

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Most lab members will quickly recognize any disparities of time and resource investment in different projects or people. These may arise for valid strategic reasons: funding priorities, timeliness of publication, contractual needs. Having clear and transparent policies for access to lab resources avoids biases from the group leader, inter-personal conflict, and fosters cooperativity between projects.

## Suggestions
- Implement a shared lab calendar and booking system for communal instruments
- Monitor and enforce respectful and fair booking schedules
- Discuss project investment at onboarding
- Keep a record of expenditure for different projects
- Implement a task request system for shared lab technicians (e.g. apps in Teams)
- Prioritize publications based on agreed plan rather than impact
- Document the feedback process to report any perceived inequalities

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ It is important to us that all team members have access to the lab resources they need. Essential courses (animal licenses) and essential equipment (e.g. a powerful data processing computer) are guaranteed and paid for by the school/lab. Fair does not always mean equal since team members might have different contracts, personal resources, responsibilities and work-related needs. Lab and school resources (equipment, consumables) are accessible to everyone and will be allocated based on project needs without favoritism. Expenses, including for conferences and courses, are documented and visible to all lab members. We do not strive to guarantee the same amount of money to every member since certain events are much more costly than others, but to guarantee equal access to opportunities that are relevant to each member. Members with external funding (travel grants, bench fees from personal grants) may be able to attend more events, have more independence in their decision of which events to attend and/or might have exclusive access to equipment they bought with their grants. If a lab member feels unfairly treated, please raise the issue promptly as described in the section “Lab and inter-personal issues”. As a rule of thumb, the following applies:
>
>PhD candidates: Conferences/workshops: Every PhD candidate that is hired by the school has access to ~700 Euro/year to be used for conferences, summer schools etc. In their first year, students are encouraged to focus on lectures and getting to know the lab, their project and relevant techniques. They might use this money to attend technical workshops or online data analysis courses. In their 2nd-4th year, they are encouraged to attend one conference per year. The PI will do her best to complement these resources if necessary with lab funds. PhD candidates are requested to apply for travel grants whenever possible and adequate.
>Personal laptop: All heavy computing (data processing, analysis etc.) can be done on lab servers that include the necessary software licenses. For writing, smaller analysis tasks, and presentation preparation, PhD students can request 400 Euro from the school towards buying a computer/laptop. Furthermore, everyone can get access to a school-owned desktop computer. Students are encouraged to acquire a laptop through this channel since the computer then belongs to them. If this is not an option, buying a laptop from school funds can be discussed with the PI, but will belong to the school. 
>
>Postdocs: Conferences/workshops: Postdocs will in most cases be hired either on a lab grant (e.g. ERC) or a personal fellowship (MSCA etc.). In either case, these grants normally include a budget for conference attendances. In general, the PI will do her best to guarantee attendance of at least 1 conference or summer school per year. Postdocs are requested to apply for travel grants whenever possible and adequate.
>Personal laptop: All heavy computing (data processing, analysis etc.) can be done on lab servers that include the necessary software licenses. For writing, smaller analysis tasks, and presentation preparation, everyone can get access to a school-owned desktop computer. Buying a laptop from school funds can be discussed with the PI but will belong to the school. 
>
>Technicians: Conferences/workshops: Technicians will generally not attend conferences, but might want to attend technical workshops. Technicians will in most cases be hired on a lab grant (e.g. ERC) where a budget is allocated for workshops. In general, the PI will do her best to guarantee attendance of relevant workshops.
>Personal laptop: Same rules as for postdocs apply.
