# I commit to publicly document which contributions constitute authorship on a scientific paper

This page collects real-world examples of authorship policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective authorship policies!

## Details
The line between "acknowledgement" and "authorship" is not always clear. An authorship statement will never solve this problem, but it should act as a starting point for discussions when lab members are prospectively, or retrospectively, considering their role in a project. It should be publicly documented so that prospective lab members are aware of the authorship policy before applying to join a lab.

## Suggestions
- Acknowledge that authorship can be difficult to define
- State when authorship will be discussed during project development
- Specify how contributions will be acknowledged in publications
- Follow CREDIT taxonomy for defining contributions
- Document the process for determining author order
- Include policy for handling authorship disputes
- Consider contributions that typically constitute authorship vs acknowledgement

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Authorship vs acknowledgement is not always clear for a publication, but typically all contributors to a paper are included as authors, where contribution is broadly defined by CRediT Taxonomy. For example, developing a new technique for a project, or contributing previously unpublished data/figures would constitute authorship. Conversely, routine experimental work, sharing basic analysis code, or proof-reading a paper would not constitute authorship. Authorship is ultimately decided in discussions between the group leader, project lead(s), and any other potential authors. Although the scientific process is unpredictable, authorship will be discussed when a lab member begins, or becomes involved with, a project. Whenever possible, we publish a matrix of contributions at the end of each paper.
