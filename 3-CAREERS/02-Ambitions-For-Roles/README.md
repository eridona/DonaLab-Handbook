# I commit to publicly document my ambitions for the duration and publication outputs for each lab role

This page collects real-world examples of role ambitions and expectations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective role ambition policies!

## Details
Science is impossible to predict, and no one can guarantee the outcome of a given PhD or postdoctoral research position. However, group leaders vary in their expectations for what a typical PhD/postdoctoral research project should involve. Making the ambitions (despite the variability inherent to science) for each role clear should reduce expectation mismatch between new lab members and group leaders.

## Suggestions
- Include any institutional/country-based requirements for PhDs (e.g. max length, publications)
- Provide statistics on how long lab members typically stay in the lab
- Document and discuss ambitions for application to fellowships and additional funding
- Be transparent about publication expectations and timelines
- Clarify opportunities for career development and training
- Outline mentoring and supervision structure

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Every PhD and postdoctoral researcher position in the lab inevitably has its own set of experimental challenges and funding complications. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the outcome of any project, and I cannot make guarantees with respect to timelines or publications. However, my ambition for each role is as follows:
>
>PhD students in the UK typically graduate ~3-4 years after joining the lab, and it is my aim that each student has at least one first (or co-first) authored publication on bioRxiv at that time. I select PhD projects (in discussion with the student) with this aim in mind. Depending on the current funding status of the lab, it may be possible for students to remain in the lab for a period after their PhD, and this will be discussed at least one year in advance of graduation.
>
>Postdoctoral researchers typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. All positions in the university are also subject a twelve-month probationary period. I will be transparent about these restrictions in the initial job advertisement, and in discussions with any applicant. I aim to propose projects (in discussion with the researcher) to maximise the chance of a publication within the initial contractâ€™s timeframe. At least one year before the end of the contract period, I will discuss the next steps with the researcher, which may include the option to stay longer in the lab (with or without applying for their own funding).
