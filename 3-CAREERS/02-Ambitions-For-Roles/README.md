# I commit to publicly document my ambitions for the duration and publication outputs for each lab role

This page collects real-world examples of role ambitions and expectations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective role ambition policies!

## Details
Science is impossible to predict, and no one can guarantee the outcome of a given PhD or postdoctoral research position. However, group leaders vary in their expectations for what a typical PhD/postdoctoral research project should involve. Making the ambitions (despite the variability inherent to science) for each role clear should reduce expectation mismatch between new lab members and group leaders.

## Suggestions
- Include any institutional/country-based requirements for PhDs (e.g. max length, publications)
- Provide statistics on how long lab members typically stay in the lab
- Document and discuss ambitions for application to fellowships and additional funding
- Be transparent about publication expectations and timelines
- Clarify opportunities for career development and training
- Outline mentoring and supervision structure

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Researchers in different roles will spend different amounts of time in the lab. Furthermore, technical challenges and other unknown or unforeseen aspects may delay projects. It is hence difficult to predict how many papers each team member will publish. As a rule of thumb, the following applies:
>PhD students: PhD candidates need to finish their PhD within 4 years. Projects are selected and adjusted so that it should be possible to have at least a paper draft by the end of these 4 years. While this is the minimum, the aim is to have a first-author manuscript on biorxiv and likely submitted by the end of the PhD. Due to the collaborative nature of our work, students can expect to be contributing author on at least a second paper.
>Postdocs: While postdoc contracts will usually be for 12 months, the PI clearly communicates funding availability and expected total duration of the postdoc (generally to be anticipated to be at least 3 years). The aim is to have at least one first-author paper in that time-frame and to likely contribute to multiple projects in the lab. Changes to funding or anticipated duration and publications will be communicated openly and timely. Conversely, postdocs may decide to move on to new positions and challenges before a publication has been achieved. 
>Master students / interns: Master theses last for at least 9, ideally 12 months. The main purpose of a thesis is for the student to learn one or more practical techniques, to understand all steps of a scientific project, to get insights into analysis of data, and to practice scientific writing and figure making, as well as scientific communication. The actual content and output are less important. However, if a student contributes a relevant data set which is included in a publication, they will certainly be granted authorship as detailed in the CRediT Taxonomy guidelines. 
>Technicians: Technicians’ contracts may be more variable and depend on needs and agreements. If technicians’ contributions fulfill the CRediT Taxonomy guidelines, they will be authors on papers.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Every PhD and postdoctoral researcher position in the lab inevitably has its own set of experimental challenges and funding complications. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the outcome of any project, and I cannot make guarantees with respect to timelines or publications. However, my ambition for each role is as follows:
>
>PhD students in the UK typically graduate ~3-4 years after joining the lab, and it is my aim that each student has at least one first (or co-first) authored publication on bioRxiv at that time. I select PhD projects (in discussion with the student) with this aim in mind. Depending on the current funding status of the lab, it may be possible for students to remain in the lab for a period after their PhD, and this will be discussed at least one year in advance of graduation.
>
>Postdoctoral researchers typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. All positions in the university are also subject a twelve-month probationary period. I will be transparent about these restrictions in the initial job advertisement, and in discussions with any applicant. I aim to propose projects (in discussion with the researcher) to maximise the chance of a publication within the initial contract’s timeframe. At least one year before the end of the contract period, I will discuss the next steps with the researcher, which may include the option to stay longer in the lab (with or without applying for their own funding).
