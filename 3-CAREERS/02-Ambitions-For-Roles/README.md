# I commit to publicly document my ambitions for the duration and publication outputs for each lab role

This page collects real-world examples of role ambitions and expectations from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective role ambition policies!

## Details
Science is impossible to predict, and no one can guarantee the outcome of a given PhD or postdoctoral research position. However, group leaders vary in their expectations for what a typical PhD/postdoctoral research project should involve. Making the ambitions (despite the variability inherent to science) for each role clear should reduce expectation mismatch between new lab members and group leaders.

## Suggestions
- Include any institutional/country-based requirements for PhDs (e.g. max length, publications)
- Provide statistics on how long lab members typically stay in the lab
- Document and discuss ambitions for application to fellowships and additional funding
- Be transparent about publication expectations and timelines
- Clarify opportunities for career development and training
- Outline mentoring and supervision structure
