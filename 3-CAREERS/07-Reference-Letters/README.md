# I commit to internally document the procedure for requesting reference letters

This page collects real-world examples of reference letter policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective reference letter policies!

## Details
Career progression, grants, and competitive applications often require reference letters from mentors and supervisors. However, it is not uncommon to reuse the same letter with minimal changes, or even ask lab members to draft their own letters. These practices undermine the purpose of the reference system. SAFE Labs group leaders are required to personally write and sign all recommendation letters they agree to provide—possibly in collaboration with a co-supervisor (but never the subject of the letter).

## Suggestions
- Specify notification period for requests
- Be transparent about reference content
- Include co-supervisors as signatories where appropriate
- Define process for urgent requests
- Document required information from requestor
- Set expectations for letter turnaround time
- Outline preferred submission methods
- Consider policy for post-departure references

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ To guarantee that Pip provides your letter, **you must give at least 2 weeks notice**.

>Mistakes do happen, and if you do not give 2 weeks notice, Pip will of course try to accommodate your needs. However, this cannot be guaranteed—particularly if it is the first letter you are asking for—and it is your responsibility to monitor deadlines and notify Pip in advance.

>For his part, Pip will write, and personalize all reference letters. When appropriate (e.g. for a Masters project where the student works closely with a postdoc) Pip may write the letter in collaboration with a lab member, and co-sign the letter with them.
