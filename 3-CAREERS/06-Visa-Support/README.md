# I commit to publicly document the visa application process and associated costs

This page collects real-world examples of visa support policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective visa support policies!

## Details
For international lab members, visa costs and processes can be a significant barrier to joining a lab. Being transparent about these requirements and any available support helps candidates make informed decisions and plan accordingly. Different positions may have different levels of institutional support available for visa processes.

## Suggestions
- Document typical visa costs by country
- Outline application timeline expectations
- Specify which costs are covered by the lab
- Include required language tests and certifications
- List institutional support services available
- Detail healthcare contribution requirements
- Provide guidance for family visa applications
- Include visa renewal procedures

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ If you do not have the right-to-work in the UK (either as a UK citizen, or through a different scheme) you will likely need a visa to join the lab as a postdoctoral researcher, or similar position. Information about visas can be found on the UCL website here. Visas, such as the skilled worker visa (most common for postdoctoral researchers) come with significant upfront costs. Some of these costs can be covered by UCL. Often, the full costs can be coveredâ€“including costs for partners and family members. However, this is not always the case, and does depend on the source of finds being used to hire a lab member. If this information is not clear from a job advertisement, or you are interested in applying for a position via an external grant or fellowship, please raise your concerns with Pip directly.
