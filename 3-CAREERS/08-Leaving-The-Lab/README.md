# Leaving-The-Lab

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Leaving-The-Lab.

# I commit to publicly document policies for lab members leaving the group

This page collects real-world examples of lab departure policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective departure policies!

## Details
Staff and students can choose to leave a lab for various reasons. If the expectations for the person leaving are clearly stated in advance (e.g. typical timeline, procedure, and support provided), it will help to make the process as smooth and amicable as possible. Exit interviews are a requisite part of this process in SAFE Labs. They are invaluable for identifying aspects of the lab that work well, and which could be improved.

## Suggestions
- Encourage open discussion about career transitions
- Define notice period expectations
- Outline project handover procedures
- Include data management requirements
- Structure exit interviews with standard questions
- Consider external interviewer for exit interviews
- Support job/grant applications during transition
- Maintain alumni network connections
- Document knowledge transfer process

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ It is normal that people will leave the lab, either because they have finished their project, or because they’ve found a new opportunity or for personal reasons. Lab members are encouraged to talk to the PI as soon as they consider leaving the lab. It will not be held against anyone if they want to leave, instead, the PI is dedicated to providing support in planning the next steps or to finding solutions in case the leave is due to health/personal reasons. Once someone has decided to leave, the following steps need to be taken:
>
>As early as possible:
>- Make sure knowledge is transferred and at least one current lab member is trained in relevant techniques.
>- Discuss how ongoing projects will be continued, how authorship might change etc.
>
>In the week(s) before leaving:
>- Make sure that all documentation (lab book, meta data files) is up to date.
>- Make sure that all work-related documents are saved in an accessible place.
>- Clean out personal reagents etc. from fridges. 
>
>In the last week:
>- 1o1 meeting with the PI to go together through the update documentation, discuss and give mutual feedback on the lab member’s time in the lab, and to discuss next steps concerning ongoing projects if adequate.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ People leave the lab for all kinds of reasons—whether it is after several Postdoc years, or after a summer project. Hopefully, they are leaving for exciting new opportunities or retiring as a crypto-millionaire. Regardless of the reason for leaving, there is a checklist of items to consider (for Pip or the lab member). While opportunities may arise unexpectedly, please give Pip as much notice as possible so that this transition can take place as smoothly!
>
>#### Offboarding Checklist
>
>- Go over personal folders for data/code: cleanup, comment, and commit
>    - Document workflows, protocols, or specific responsibilities
>- Discuss any skills training/transfer to be completed (e.g. surgical techniques)
>- Return any physical keys (e.g. to the Darwin Office)
>- Remove your personal data and accounts from any lab computers
>    - You will retain access to the server for data analysis etc.
>- (Potentially) change administrative permissions/membership in the lab:
>    - Slack
>    - Github
>    - Mailing list
>    - Notion
>    - Website
>
>#### Exit Interviews
>
>*The content of exit interviews will not be shared with other lab members*
>
>In addition to completing the steps above, Pip arranges for all lab members to have an exit interview with himself, or another member of the lab. If the lab is to improve, and become a more inclusive and equitable environment, Pip need to know which aspects of the lab are working well, and which are not. Discussing these elements (particularly any that are negative) of lab experience can become easier when leaving, and that is why exit interviews are so valuable.
>
>Of course, the Coen Lab, and my style of supervision, is not the right fit for every scientist: the purpose of rotations and probations is to (hopefully) figure that out before committing to a long-term project together. That is to be expected and is an important part of the process.
>
>However, if someone is leaving the lab because they have been made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, *that is not to be expected and is not okay*. If you experienced something like this during your time in the lab, please raise it during your exit interview so Pip can take steps to prevent it happening again. Naturally, Pip hopes lab members feel able to raise these concerns as soon as they arise so he can take immediate action: you can submit concerns at any time in regular meetings, or anonymously [here]).
