# Leaving-The-Lab

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Leaving-The-Lab.

# I commit to publicly document policies for lab members leaving the group

This page collects real-world examples of lab departure policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective departure policies!

## Details
Staff and students can choose to leave a lab for various reasons. If the expectations for the person leaving are clearly stated in advance (e.g. typical timeline, procedure, and support provided), it will help to make the process as smooth and amicable as possible. Exit interviews are a requisite part of this process in SAFE Labs. They are invaluable for identifying aspects of the lab that work well, and which could be improved.

## Suggestions
- Encourage open discussion about career transitions
- Define notice period expectations
- Outline project handover procedures
- Include data management requirements
- Structure exit interviews with standard questions
- Consider external interviewer for exit interviews
- Support job/grant applications during transition
- Maintain alumni network connections
- Document knowledge transfer process
