# I commit to publicly document expectations and funding for conference/summer school attendance

This page collects real-world examples of conference and training attendance policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective conference attendance policies!

## Details
Conferences, workshops, and other training opportunities (e.g. summer schools) are valuable resources for dissemination, acquiring new expertise, networking, and career development. Therefore, prospective lab members need to understand the lab policy with respect to attending these opportunities so they can make informed decisions and avoid subsequent expectation mismatch. At a minimum, state the typical lab resources available for attending these opportunities, both with respect to financial support and time, and all lab members in the same role should have equal access to these lab resources.

## Suggestions
- Define limitations on which conferences lab members can attend
- Clarify any restrictions on using personal research funds
- Specify requirements for attendance and financial support
- Outline expectations for different lab roles
- Establish criteria for when projects are ready for presentation
- Keep a transparent record of attendance
- Mark major conferences and related deadlines in the lab calendar
- Discuss opportunities in annual appraisals

>**Conference attendance** Each postdoctoral researcher and PhD student has an annual budget of £1000 to attend conferences. This can be accumulated across years if that is the preference, and can be used for one expensive conference or multiple inexpensive conferences. Lab members should discuss their conference plans with me before committing to attend a particular meeting. Lab members do not need to present anything when attending their first conference after joining the lab, but should present at any future conferences, or organize a workshop/symposium, if they are planning to attend. If lab members have additional funds through grants or their PhD programme, these can be used in addition to the £1000 annual budget. I am happy to make an exception to this rule and provide extra funds if allowed by current grants, and an excellent opportunity arises that would exceed this budget (e.g. a unique conference, an invitation to give a prestigious talk). Lab members are encouraged to supplement this funding with applications to grants, either from the conference itself (e.g. fee waivers for new attendees), or from external sources.

>Master’s students, undergraduates, and lab technicians are also encouraged to attend conferences if they have work to present. They should discuss these opportunities in advance with me. Often, there are grants available from conference organisers to support attendance, and if this is not the case, or the application for funds is unsuccessful, I will consider funding attendance on a case-by-case basis.

>**Summer schools and courses:**
>Typically, I expect both PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to attend a competitive training school and/or a conference by the end of their second year in the lab. The lab will support applications (e.g. with recommendation letters) to these initiatives when they align with a project or planned career development. When funds are available, and application to fees waivers are not successful, the lab will cover the costs for at least one such opportunity. Some courses that can help to develop the experimental and computational skills we use in the lab include:
