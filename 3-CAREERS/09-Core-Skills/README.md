# I commit to establish annual lab-wide meetings to review training and outcomes for "core skills"

This page collects real-world examples of core skills training approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective core skills training programs!

## Details
Researchers often focus on scientific progress and neglect the development of core skills, including team management, giving/receiving feedback, writing, presentations etc. An annual meeting for lab members, including the group leader, to discuss their efforts toward improving these skills not only normalizes the process but also alerts other lab members to potential opportunities.

## Suggestions
- Each lab member discusses training undertaken and shares learning outcomes
- Survey the need for focused training in key areas
- Highlight available resources and training opportunities
- Share books and resources for self-education
- Include progress reviews and goal setting
- Document training achievements and certificates
- Create mentoring pairs for skill development
- Maintain a shared resource library
