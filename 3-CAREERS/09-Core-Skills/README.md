# I commit to establish annual lab-wide meetings to review training and outcomes for "core skills"

This page collects real-world examples of core skills training approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective core skills training programs!

## Details
Researchers often focus on scientific progress and neglect the development of core skills, including team management, giving/receiving feedback, writing, presentations etc. An annual meeting for lab members, including the group leader, to discuss their efforts toward improving these skills not only normalizes the process but also alerts other lab members to potential opportunities.

## Suggestions
- Each lab member discusses training undertaken and shares learning outcomes
- Survey the need for focused training in key areas
- Highlight available resources and training opportunities
- Share books and resources for self-education
- Include progress reviews and goal setting
- Document training achievements and certificates
- Create mentoring pairs for skill development
- Maintain a shared resource library

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Core skills such as team/time management, feedback, writing, and presentations are crucial to a scientific career. Many of these are addressed during daily interactions. For instance, the PI commits to giving extensive and comprehensive feedback on writing tasks, giving presentations is practiced during regular lab meetings and specifically when a public presentation is coming up, and lab members are encouraged to attend courses on management, writing and communication. 
>We currently do not have an annual meeting that focuses on these skills in place. If this format is deemed useful by the lab members, it’ll be implemented in the future.

>To this end, we have an annual meeting focused on Core Skills each year—typically in September/October when the academic calendar is beginning, providing potential opportunities to improve core skills. The precise nature of this meeting will vary. Usually, Pip will present on a particular topic for ~20-30 minutes, and then other lab members will speak about core skills opportunities they have developed in the past year, or are hoping to develop in the coming year. For more specifics of the agenda and process, please look at the corresponding entry in the _Lab Meetings Database_.
