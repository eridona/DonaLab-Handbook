# I commit to establish a mechanism for sharing lab management updates

This page collects real-world examples of lab management communication approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective lab management communication strategies!

## Details
Lab members are often considering academia as a potential career. It informs that decision to understand how the group leader runs the lab, the responsibilities they have, and the process of funding a research team. However, lab members are typically shielded from this information. To improve transparency, and give lab members a greater insight into academic careers, group leaders should regularly communicate details of lab management.

## Suggestions
- Give annual or bi-annual lab meetings on lab management
- Send regular updates with recent lab developments
- Discuss spending, grants, and future outlook
- Solicit feedback on grant applications
- Share institutional policies and requirements
- Include updates on equipment and resources
- Communicate staffing changes and recruitment plans
- Discuss publication strategies and timelines
