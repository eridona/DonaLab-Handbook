# I commit to establish a mechanism for sharing lab management updates

This page collects real-world examples of lab management communication approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective lab management communication strategies!

## Details
Lab members are often considering academia as a potential career. It informs that decision to understand how the group leader runs the lab, the responsibilities they have, and the process of funding a research team. However, lab members are typically shielded from this information. To improve transparency, and give lab members a greater insight into academic careers, group leaders should regularly communicate details of lab management.

## Suggestions
- Give annual or bi-annual lab meetings on lab management
- Send regular updates with recent lab developments
- Discuss spending, grants, and future outlook
- Solicit feedback on grant applications
- Share institutional policies and requirements
- Include updates on equipment and resources
- Communicate staffing changes and recruitment plans
- Discuss publication strategies and timelines

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Several mechanisms are in place to update all team members on lab management issues (responsibilities of lab managers, funding situation, costs etc.):
>Biweekly lab meetings: The PI presents at the biweekly lab meetings. Often, these presentations will be about lab management related aspects.
>Lab costs and funding are documented in detail and accessible to all lab members. Like this, everyone can get an idea of what “stuff costs” and what the funding situation of the lab is.
>Grant applications are shared and, if adequate, lab members contribute to writing, budgeting etc. 
>Postdocs who aim to leave soon will have dedicated meetings with the PI to discuss relevant aspects to lab management.
>The PI participates often in informal lunches, coffee breaks or other opportunities to ask and discuss about lab management topics.
