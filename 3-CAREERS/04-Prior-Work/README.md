# I commit to publicly document guidelines for completing previous work after joining the lab

This page collects real-world examples of policies for handling prior work commitments from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective prior work policies!

## Details
We are all familiar with the experience of joining a new lab whilst still having outstanding academic work from a previous position. It is important to discuss this process with all new lab members to ensure that they progress to new projects in a timeframe that works for everyone. Discussing this policy is a required component of the onboarding process for postdoctoral researchers.

## Suggestions
- Arrange flexible start dates for completion of prior work
- Acknowledge unpredictable timelines for paper revisions
- Define reasonable time allocation for past work
- Include policy for independent projects
- Address co-authorship with previous lab
- Set milestones for transitioning to new work
- Outline communication with previous PI
- Consider impact on current project timelines

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ It is completely normal for researchers, particularly postdoctoral researchers, to join the lab while still having outstanding work from their previous position, and I support lab members taking time to complete this work. The period during which they will need to continue previous work is understandably hard to predict, but ideally it will not last more than 6 months. If finishing previous work is expected to last longer than this, it may be more sensible to delay the start of their position in the lab if possible. In general, time spent on previous work should not exceed 25% (although this will naturally vary over time).
