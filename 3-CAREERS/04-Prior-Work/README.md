# I commit to publicly document guidelines for completing previous work after joining the lab

This page collects real-world examples of policies for handling prior work commitments from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective prior work policies!

## Details
We are all familiar with the experience of joining a new lab whilst still having outstanding academic work from a previous position. It is important to discuss this process with all new lab members to ensure that they progress to new projects in a timeframe that works for everyone. Discussing this policy is a required component of the onboarding process for postdoctoral researchers.

## Suggestions
- Arrange flexible start dates for completion of prior work
- Acknowledge unpredictable timelines for paper revisions
- Define reasonable time allocation for past work
- Include policy for independent projects
- Address co-authorship with previous lab
- Set milestones for transitioning to new work
- Outline communication with previous PI
- Consider impact on current project timelines

>_[BugeonLab_2025](https://www.inmed.fr/en/circuits-neuronaux-et-codage-sensoriel):_ We encourage lab members to complete and publish research from their previous positions. To balance this with current project responsibilities, please follow these guidelines:
>
> General Allocation: You may dedicate up to 25% of your working hours to finalizing prior commitments.
>
> Deadline Exceptions: We understand that deadlines for paper resubmissions or conferences require intensive focus. During these critical periods, you may dedicate more time as needed. Please communicate with me in advance so we can plan accordingly.

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ It is common that one leaves a previous position before the final acceptance of a manuscript. Every new team member who needs to contribute to the completion of previous work needs to discuss the details with the PI and come to an agreement of the percentage of time and the duration of these contributions.

>_[RossiLab 2025](https://rossilab.iit.it/)_: New lab recruits may have ongoing work from their previous position: I support committing time to complete this work, but the details of their contribution and time committment to external projects must be discussed and agreed with me. While the duration of these committments is understandably hard to predict, ideally it will not last longer than 6 months. If finishing previous work is expected to last longer than 6 months, researchers should delay the start of their position in the lab whenever possible. Finally, in no case time spent on previous work should exceed ~25%.

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ It is completely normal for researchers, particularly postdoctoral researchers, to join the lab while still having outstanding work from their previous position, and I support lab members taking time to complete this work. The period during which they will need to continue previous work is understandably hard to predict, but ideally it will not last more than 6 months. If finishing previous work is expected to last longer than this, it may be more sensible to delay the start of their position in the lab if possible. In general, time spent on previous work should not exceed 25% (although this will naturally vary over time).
