# I commit to publicly document the salary and funding expectations for postdoctoral researchers

This page collects real-world examples of postdoctoral funding policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective postdoctoral funding policies!

## Details
Postdoctoral researchers typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. Being transparent about funding restrictions, salary scales, and expectations for securing additional funding helps prospective postdocs make informed decisions about joining the lab.

## Suggestions
- Include starting salary information
- Clarify expectations for fellowship applications
- Specify contract duration and renewal possibilities
- Document salary progression structure
- Outline available funding for research costs
- Detail support for fellowship applications
- Describe benefits package and allowances
- Include institutional grading systems

>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Any advertised postdoctoral position is fully funded for the duration specified on the job advertisement. However, all postdocs are required to apply for funding and fellowships when accepting a position in the lab. This is for three reasons:
>1. It helps to crystalise their project approach and hypotheses
>2. Fellowships are valuable additions to a researcherâ€™s CV
>3. It can provide additional funding for professional activities (e.g. travel)
