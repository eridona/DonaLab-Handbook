# I commit to publicly document the salary and funding expectations for postdoctoral researchers

This page collects real-world examples of postdoctoral funding policies from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective postdoctoral funding policies!

## Details
Postdoctoral researchers typically join the lab with an initial contract, and the length of that contract depends on both the source of funding and their proposed project. Being transparent about funding restrictions, salary scales, and expectations for securing additional funding helps prospective postdocs make informed decisions about joining the lab.

## Suggestions
- Include starting salary information
- Clarify expectations for fellowship applications
- Specify contract duration and renewal possibilities
- Document salary progression structure
- Outline available funding for research costs
- Detail support for fellowship applications
- Describe benefits package and allowances
- Include institutional grading systems

Available funding depends on current grants and project goals and will be discussed with each researcher during hiring and onboarding. In general, funding for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers is available for at least 3 years. Typically, I will ask postdocs and graduate students, where appropriate, to apply for funding. I guide and support the grant writing process. This helps to crystalise their project approach and hypotheses, are valuable additions to a researcher’s CV, and can provide additional funding for professional activities (e.g. travel).

### Italy
>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ There are no (very few) Italian personal grants for postdocs. Hence, funding can come from one out of three sources: (1) Lab grant, (2) EU fellowship (MSCA etc.), (3) School funds. Since 2025, postdoc contracts are work contracts that include taxes, contributions to pension schemes etc. The details of these contracts will be communicated by HR. Postdocs can likely expect the following salaries and contract durations:
>1. Lab grants: Initial contracts are for 12 months, but there will be clear communication about the duration of the current funding and the anticipated duration of the postdoc (typically at least 3 years). If funds allow, we aim to pay more than Italian standard postdoc contracts, currently we pay around 27’000-30’000 Euro net per year from which only a small health care contribution needs to be subtracted. 
>2. EU fellowships: Typical fellowship durations are 2-3 years. Salaries can vary widely and are determined by the agency; they cannot be “topped-up” by other funding sources. An MSCA currently pays more than double of a typical Italian postdoc salary.
>3. School funds: Depending on school budgets, there are certain numbers of “postdoc months” that can be paid from school money. Durations are variable but will be max. 12 months. How these fellowships will look like exactly under the new law is not clear yet.

>For comparisons, salaries of personnel and faculty at different stages are public and can be found [here](https://www.sissa.it/servizi-informazioni-personale/salary-tables).

### United Kingdom
>_[CoenLab_2025](https://coen-lab.com/):_ Any advertised postdoctoral position is fully funded for the duration specified on the job advertisement. However, all postdocs are required to apply for funding and fellowships when accepting a position in the lab. This is for three reasons:
>1. It helps to crystalise their project approach and hypotheses
>2. Fellowships are valuable additions to a researcher’s CV
>3. It can provide additional funding for professional activities (e.g. travel)
