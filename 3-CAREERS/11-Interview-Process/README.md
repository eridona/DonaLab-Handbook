# I commit to publicly document an objective and equitable interview process

This page collects real-world examples of interview processes from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective interview processes!

## Details
The decision to recruit an applicant should depend on clear selection criteria to help avoid personal biases and to treat all applicants fairly. Some of the suggestions below may be impractical or impossible given institutional constraints, but group leaders should implement as many as possible.

## Suggestions
- Conduct blind CV screenings
- Post public job advertisements
- Recruit a diverse interview panel
- Get second opinions from lab members and collaborators
- Ask standardized questions for each position
- Consider implementing a structured selection process:
  1. File and advertise an open call
  2. Offer informal chats for questions
  3. Shortlist qualified candidates
  4. Conduct formal interviews
  5. Arrange lab presentations
  6. Formalize offers
  7. Provide feedback to unsuccessful candidates

>_[ReinhardLab_2025](https://reinhardlab.org/philosophy):_ Hiring should not depend on personal biases, applicant names or other similar aspects. On one hand, the Italian recruitment system restricts to some degree the possibility for e.g. blind screening; on the other hand, academic work is based on often long hours in very close collaboration and hence, to some degree, personality and “fit” are important criteria to make sure that the new team member is happy but also that the existing team dynamics aren’t interrupted. In summary, to hire fairly and equitably is not easy. Given those considerations, the steps that are taken by the PI to make hiring as fair as possible are the following:
>- All CVs are read and evaluated with the same interest and dedication, independently of applicants’ names or affiliations.
>- Reasons for or against candidates are documented (although not publicly).
>- Postdoc candidates are informed about the types of questions that will be asked during the interview.
