# I commit to publicly document the lab code of conduct: emphasise welfare, equity and integrity

This page collects real-world examples of lab codes of conduct from around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own code of conduct here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective codes of conduct!

## Details 
A prominent code of conduct should help to establish the lab atmosphere, foster synergy and collaboration, and make lab members feel valued and respected. It will set boundaries and shared practices, and establish a common framework to reduce and resolve conflict.

## Suggestions
- Set out expectations for professional behaviour
- Include timekeeping for meetings, work requests, and assignments
- Require engagement with presentations, opinions, and requests from other members
- Avoid exclusive communication channels (e.g. cc everyone when applicable)
