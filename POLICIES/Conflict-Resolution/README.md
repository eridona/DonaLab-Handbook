# Conflict-Resolution

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Conflict-Resolution.

# I commit to internally document the procedure for raising lab or inter-personal issues

This page collects real-world examples of conflict resolution procedures from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective conflict resolution procedures!

## Details
One prominent reason that lab and inter-personal issues are not raised in a timely and constructive fashion is the lack of a documented procedure for this process. Having a clear and transparent procedure encourages feedback from lab members, makes them more comfortable initiating feedback as the expectation is clear, and increases the likelihood that issues can be addressed before they deteriorate.

## Suggestions
- Specify that issues raised in 1-on-1 meetings won't be acted on without discussion
- Specify a reporting procedure that circumvents you if necessary
- Provide an avenue for lab members to raise concerns with you anonymously
- Establish clear timelines for addressing concerns
- Document the follow-up process
- Include options for mediation when needed
- Define escalation paths for unresolved issues
- Protect confidentiality of all parties involved
