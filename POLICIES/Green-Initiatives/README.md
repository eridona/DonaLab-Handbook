# I commit to publicly document green initiatives in the lab and any explicit rules related to sustainability

This page collects real-world examples of lab sustainability initiatives from around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own green initiatives here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section. If you feel comfortable, you can include a link to your lab's website alongside your example, but this is entirely optional. Your examples will help other labs develop their own effective sustainability policies!

## Details
Laboratories consume a lot of energy and produce a lot of waste. Group leaders are able to promote measures that reduce the environmental impact of scientific research, and prospective lab members may use environmental awareness as a factor when choosing labs.

## Suggestions
- Require sustainable transport options when travel time is less than 8 hours
- Recycle non-hazardous waste
- Place orders in bulk to reduce shipments
- Have a list of instruments you are happy to share with your internal collaborators
- Donate unused equipment within/outside the institutions
- Highlight schemes that incentivise sustainable commuting (e.g. cycle schemes)
