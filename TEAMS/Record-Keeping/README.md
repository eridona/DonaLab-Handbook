# I commit to establish a mechanism to record key outcomes from each 1-on-1 meeting

This page collects real-world examples of meeting record-keeping approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Commonly reported frustrations of the 1-on-1 meeting process in labs are:
1. Lab members feel that their group leader forgets the content of their previous meeting and so appears disengaged, or time is wasted rehashing the previous meeting.
2. Group leaders feel that a previously agreed course of action has not been followed (or even attempted) and the lab member has instead pursued an unrelated tangent.

Recording the key outcomes of each 1-on-1 meeting immediately after it takes place has been reported to robustly improve these issues. It allows any miscommunication to be readily identified, and provides a way for all participants to refresh their memory before the next meetingâ€”saving time and confusion.

## Suggestions
- Require lab members to summarize each meeting in a shared document
- Include agreed-upon action points to prioritize before the next meeting
- Lab members should take notes during the meeting
- Group leader should read the document after/before meetings (to catch misunderstandings)
- Other solutions include allowing the lab member to record meetings (e.g. via zoom)
