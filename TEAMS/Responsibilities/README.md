# I commit to publicly document the responsibilities of each lab role and the training provided

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Each group leader has their own expectations for lab roles (PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, lab technicians etc.). By explicitly stating the responsibilities associated to different positions, group leaders can pre-empt expectation mismatch for prospective lab members before and after they join the lab.

## Suggestions
- What is the training/experience/independence expected for each role?
- Does the role involve a research project?
- Does the role involve applying for funding?
- Does the role involve supervising other lab members?
- Will the role be supervised by another lab member?
- Does the role involve house-keeping tasks?
- What level of supervision/training will be offered?
