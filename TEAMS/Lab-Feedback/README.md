# I commit to establish annual lab-wide feedback sessions

This page collects real-world examples of lab-wide feedback approaches from labs around the world. We encourage all labs implementing the SAFE Labs Handbook to share their own approach here. To contribute, simply create a pull request adding your commitment under the appropriate country section.

## Details
Implementing guidelines for giving and receiving feedback is good practice to enhance communication and foster a positive work environment. Regular structured feedback helps improve lab operations, identify areas for improvement, and ensure all lab members feel heard.

## Suggestions
- In a large lab, could be an anonymous survey
- In a small lab, could involve explicitly soliciting non-anonymous feedback
- New group leaders could combine lab retreats/lab meetings to improve feedback
- Communicate feedback decisions and if suggestions are not implemented, explain why
- Follow up on feedback implementation
