# Resource-Access

This folder contains documentation and examples for the SAFE Labs Handbook commitment regarding Resource-Access.

# I commit to publicly document how equal access to lab resources across lab members is maintained

We encourage the community to contribute to this policy by submitting pull requests with suggestions and improvements.

## Details
Most lab members will quickly recognize any disparities of time and resource investment in different projects or people. These may arise for valid strategic reasons: funding priorities, timeliness of publication, contractual needs. Having clear and transparent policies for access to lab resources avoids biases from the group leader, inter-personal conflict, and fosters cooperativity between projects.

## Suggestions
- Implement a shared lab calendar and booking system for communal instruments
- Monitor and enforce respectful and fair booking schedules
- Discuss project investment at onboarding
- Keep a record of expenditure for different projects
- Implement a task request system for shared lab technicians (e.g. apps in Teams)
- Prioritize publications based on agreed plan rather than impact
- Document the feedback process to report any perceived inequalities
