# Dona Lab Handbook

In the Don√† lab we believe that creating a fair, transparent, and inclusive research environment is essential for academic success and well-being. For this we marry the philosophy promoted by **SAFE Labs (Starting Aware, Fair, and Equitable)** initiative (https://safelabs.info/).

This page is where publicly documented commitments guiding lab life are stored.
